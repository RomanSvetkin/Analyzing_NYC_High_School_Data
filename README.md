# Analyzing_NYC_High_School_Data
The results of the standardized "SAT"-exam is used by US-colleges to determine which high school graduates they admit. Understanding if there are any unintended patterns or reasons discriminating against certain groups of students is an important step to making the US education system more equal - something the US Department of Education states as a "formidable challenge". To be an informed citizen on this matter (and learn some python along the way), I want to know:  Which factors drive differences in SAT-scores and thus opportunities to attend (selective) US-colleges? Bonus question: Where in NYC does one get the best high school education compared to property prices?
